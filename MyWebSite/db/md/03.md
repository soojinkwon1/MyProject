# Single Page App (SPA)
======
**By 2005, the phrase Single Page App (SPA) had started to surface.**

The entire application could be loaded once, then handled by Javascript on the client. The only round-trips required to the server would be to fetch specific pieces of data used to generate content. 2010 saw the release of BackboneJS and AngularJS, two frameworks that not only provided the building blocks to construct SPAs more effectively, but also provide some organisation for the mountain of Javascript developers had started to write. In 2011 SproutCore 2.0 was renamed to EmberJS, 2013 saw the first version of React, and in 2016 the new version of Angular was released.
